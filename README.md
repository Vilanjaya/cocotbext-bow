**4. Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)**

Module Declaration

*This Verilog module implements a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) with a configurable number of bits (N).

Internal Signal

*yreg and xreg: Registers of width N+1 used to store the current and previous states of the LFSR.*

Initial Block

*Initializes y to '1' at the beginning.*

Always Block (Sequential Logic)

*The LFSR state is updated on each positive clock edge (posedge clk) and negative clock edge (negedge clk), as well as on a negative reset edge (negedge reset_n).
The LFSR  is designed to XOR specific bits based on the feedback polynomial, and the new state is determined using these XOR operations.
The toggle_count function is called to count the number of bit toggles between the current and previous states.
If the toggle count is greater than 7, the LFSR output y is inverted; otherwise, y retains its current value.*

Toggle Count Function

*The toggle_count function calculates the number of bit toggles between two states (x and y).
It iterates through each bit and increments the count if the corresponding bits in x and y differ.*

Note

*The LFSR  is commonly used for generating pseudorandom sequences in digital systems.
The polynomial used for feedback in this LFSR  is determined by the XOR operations in the yreg assignment.*
